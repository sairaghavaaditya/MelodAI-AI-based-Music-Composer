Requirements for AI-Based Music Composition System (Django + PostgreSQL)
1. Overview

The AI-Based Music Composition System is a web application built with Django. It allows users to generate and manage AI-composed music tracks. The system will have both frontend and backend implemented in Django, with PostgreSQL as the database for robust data storage. The application will provide a smooth end-user experience, enabling music composition, playback, saving, and sharing functionalities.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 User Management

Users should be able to register and log in/out.

Support user authentication and authorization.

Users can manage their profiles (username, email, preferences).

2.2 Music Composition

Users should be able to input:

A mood/genre/theme (e.g., happy, jazz, classical).

Optional parameters like instruments, tempo, or length.

The backend should invoke an AI model to generate a composition.

The composition should be saved in MIDI or MP3 format.

2.3 Music Playback and Download

Users should be able to play generated tracks directly on the site.

Users should be able to download compositions.

Provide a playlist feature to organize generated music.

2.4 History & Storage

Users can view a history of their generated tracks.

Each track should include metadata (date, genre, duration, model used).

Tracks and metadata should be stored in PostgreSQL.

2.5 Admin Panel

Admins can manage users and compositions.

Admins can monitor system usage (e.g., number of tracks generated).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Robust database management using PostgreSQL.

Responsive frontend built with Django templates (Bootstrap/HTML/CSS/JS).

Handle multiple concurrent requests without performance degradation.

Ensure data persistence (tracks and metadata remain after server restart).

Provide clear error handling (invalid inputs, AI model failure, etc.).

Secure endpoints with proper authentication and permissions.

4. Technology Stack

Backend Framework: Django (Python)

Frontend: Django Templates (Bootstrap/HTML/JS for UI)

Database: PostgreSQL

AI Model Integration: Python-based model for music generation (can use pre-trained models like Magenta or RNN/LSTM).

File Handling: Store music files on disk or cloud (linked in DB).

5. Future Enhancements

Add collaborative features (multiple users editing/composing together).

Add user feedback loop (rate tracks to improve AI).

Provide export to different formats (WAV, FLAC).

Integrate streaming/sharing options (e.g., share to social media).

Offer a mobile-friendly PWA (Progressive Web App) experience.
